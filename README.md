This is my own playground fork for the ruhoh static blog engine.  

**This version is for [ruhohSpec v1.0](http://ruhoh.com/universal-blog-api/) and is only compatible with ruhoh gem 1.0.x.x**

See <http://ruhoh.com> for more information.

Stuff I'm working on:

- Making the index page show the most recent N posts, with "next N, previous N" buttons
- Adding support for the popeye jquery image gallery
