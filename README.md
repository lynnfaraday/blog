This is my own playground fork for the ruhoh static blog engine.  

See <http://ruhoh.com> for more information.

Stuff I'm working on:

- Making the index page show the most recent N posts, with "next N, previous N" buttons
- Adding support for the popeye jquery image gallery

These changes require my fork of the ruhoh engine to work:  https://github.com/lynnfaraday/ruhoh.rb
